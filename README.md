- 👋 Hi, I’m @enfarious the recluse. I spend more time home alone avoiding contact with folks than not
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, game design and development, 3D art, web development and so much more
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack web development, lua and always tuning the other things I already kind of know 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above as well as some FFXI addons perhaps
- 📫 Find me here or search for Enfarious on most things I exist though I rarely touch social media as I find it eats time without much real gain.
